Konkoly Numerical Suite for Tests
=================================

This repository is maintained for testing different numerical schemes solving hiperbolic and parabolic differential equation systems in multi dimensions.

The core modules are written in C++20 standard. A python wrapper is created to use diffrent tests in a more straightforward way.
